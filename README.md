# Python_Practice---1
Although I've taken some Python courses before, but this is my first time to complete Python scrips from nothing. So I guess it's worthy to be commemorated.

This practice is talking about how to write a user-defined function. Here I build a Pearson correlation function for practing because Pearson correlation is a basic calculation for user-based recommendation system.

Define a function called pearsonD. 
•	The function takes two dictionary parameters and return the Pearson Correlation. 
•	Using a single for loop to calculate the Pearson Correlation.
•	The Pearson Correlation calculation considers an item only if it was rated by both users.

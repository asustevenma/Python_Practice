** User defined function **
This practice is talking about how to write a user-defined function. Here I build a Pearson correlation function for practing because Pearson correlation is a basic calculation for user-based recommendation system.

Define a function called pearsonD. 
•	The function takes two dictionary parameters and return the Pearson Correlation
•	Using a single for loop to calculate the Pearson Correlation
•	The Pearson Correlation calculation considers an item only if it was rated by both users


** User defined class **
This practice is talking about how to write a user-defined class. Since I've built a user-defined function to calculate Pearson correlation, I can go into next step to build a user-difined class to contain more functions that will be needed in the following steps.

Define a class called similarity.
•	Code up the Class method called minkowski which takes a single parameter r, and returns the Minkowki Distance between the two dictionaries
•	Code up the Class method called pearson which takes no parameters, and returns the Pearson Correlation between the two dictionaries
•	Create an object of class similarity. Initialize it with rating dictionaries UserPRatings and UserQRatings. Call the minkowski and pearson class methods to calculate the measures between the two dictionaries
